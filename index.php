                  Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells grow uncontrollably and may spread to other parts of the body. It begins when the body’s normal cell cycle is disrupted, leading to the formation of tumors or abnormal blood cells

                  Some common early signs include unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, lumps or swellings, changes in the skin or moles, long-lasting cough, abnormal bleeding, and changes in bowel or bladder habits. However, symptoms vary by cancer type
